## Background

The Next Generation Liquefaction (NGL) Project is advancing the state of the art in liquefaction research 
and working toward providing end users with a consensus approach to assess liquefaction potential within 
a probabilistic and risk-informed framework. Specifically, NGLâ€™s goal is to first collect and organize 
liquefaction information in a common and comprehensive database to provide all researchers with a 
substantially larger, more consistent, and more reliable source of liquefaction data than existed previously. 
Based on this database, we will create probabilistic models that provide hazard- and risk-consistent bases 
for assessing liquefaction susceptibility, the potential for liquefaction to be triggered in susceptible soils, 
and the likely consequences. NGL is committed to an open and objective evaluation and integration of data, 
models and methods, as recommended in a 2016 National Academies [report](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/23474/state-of-the-art-and-practice-in-the-assessment-of-earthquake-induced-soil-liquefaction-and-its-consequences). 

The evaluation and integration of the data into new models and methods will be clear and transparent. Following these principles will ensure 
that the resulting liquefaction susceptibility, triggering, and consequence models are reliable, robust and 
vetted by the scientific community, providing a solid foundation for designing, constructing and overseeing 
critical infrastructure projects.

The NGL database is populated through a web interface at www.nextgenerationliquefaction.org/. The web interface 
provides limited capabilities for users to interact with data. Users are able to view and download data, 
but they cannot use the GUI to develop an end-to-end workflow to make scientific inferences and draw conclusions 
from the data. To facilitate end-to-end workflows, the NGL database is replicated daily to [DesignSafe](https://www.designsafe-ci.org), where 
users can interact with it using Jupyter notebooks.

## Understanding the Database Schema

The NGL database is organized into tables that are related to each other via keys. To query the database, 
you will need to understand the organizational structure of the database, called the schema. The database 
schema is documented at the following URL:

<https://nextgenerationliquefaction.org/schema/index.html>
  
## Querying Data via Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks provide the capability to query NGL data, and subsequently process, visualize, and learn from the data in an end-to-end workflow. Jupyter notebooks run in the cloud on DesignSafe, and provide a number of benefits compared with a more traditional local mode of operation:

1. The NGL database contains many GB of data, and interating with it in the cloud does not require downloading these data files to a local file system.
2. Users can collaborate in the cloud by creating DesignSafe projects where they can share processing scripts.
3. The NGL database is constantly changing as new data is added. Working in the cloud means that the data will always be up-to-date.
4. Querying the MySQL database is faster than opening individual text files to extract data.

This documentation first demonstrates how to install the database connection script, followed by several example scripts intended to serve as starting points for users who wish to develop their own tools.

## Installing Database Connection Script
 
Connecting to a relational database requires credentials, like username, password, database name, and hostname. 
Rather than requiring users to know these credentials and create their own database connections, we have created a Python package that allows users to
query the database. This code installs the package containing the database connection script for NGL:

```python
!pip install git+https://github.com/sjbrandenberg/designsafe_db
```

## Example Queries

This notebook contains example queries to illustrate how to extract data from the NGL database into Pandas dataframe objects using Python scripts in Jupyter notebooks. The notebook contains cells that perform the following operations:

1. Query contents of the SITE table
2. Query event information and associated field observations at the Wildlife liquefaction array
3. Query cone penetration test data at Wildlife liquefaction array
4. Query a list of tables in the NGL database
5. Query information about BORH table
6. Query counts of cone penetration test data, boreholes, surface wave measurements, invasive shear wave velocity measurements, liquefaction observations, and non-liquefaction observations

[ExampleQueries.ipynb](https://jupyter.designsafe-ci.org/user/name/tree/CommunityData/NGL/ExampleQueries.ipynb).

## Cone Penetration Test Viewer

The cone penetration test viewer demonstrates the following:

1. Connecting to NGL database in DesignSafe
2. Querying data from SITE, TEST, SCPG, and SCPT tables into Pandas dataframes
3. Creating dropdown widgets using the ipywidgets package to allow users to select site and test data
4. Creating HTML widget for displaying metadata after a user select a test
5. Using the ipywidgets "observe" feature to call functions when users select a widget value
6. Plotting data from the selected cone penetration test using matplotlib

Cone penetration test data plotted in the notebook include tip resistance, sleeve friction, and pore pressure. In some cases, sleeve friction and pore pressure are not measured, in which case the plots are empty.

### Code

This section describes the [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.designsafe-ci.org/user/sjbrande/notebooks/CommunityData//NGL/VS_Invasive_viewer.ipynb) available via DesignSafe. The code is broken into chunks with explanations of each section of code.

#### Import packages

In this case, we need to import ipywidgets, matplotlib, numpy, ngl_db, and pandas. The "%matplotlib notebook" works for Jupyter notebooks and the %matplotlib widget" magic works for Jupyter Lab, and renders an interactive plot in the notebook.

```python
try:
    %matplotlib widget
except:
    try:
        %matplotlib notebook
    except:
        print("Falling back to '%matplotlib inline'")
        
import ipywidgets as widgets
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import designsafe_db.ngl_db as ngl
import pandas as pd
```

### Query distinct SITE_ID and SITE_NAME for sites that have invasive geophysical tests
The query below finds distinct SITE_ID and SITE_NAME fields that contain invasive geophysical test data for the purpose of populating the site dropdown widget. 
INNER JOIN commands are required between SITE, TEST, and GINV to find sites containing invasive geophysical testdata.
A site might contain more than one CPT test, but we do not want replicated fields in the site dropdown widget. Therefore we use the "DISTINCT" command.

```python
sql = 'SELECT DISTINCT SITE.SITE_ID, SITE.SITE_NAME from SITE '
sql += 'INNER JOIN TEST ON SITE.SITE_ID = TEST.SITE_ID INNER Join GINV ON GINV.TEST_ID = TEST.TEST_ID'
site_df = ngl.read_sql(sql)
```    

### Create key, value pairs for SITE_NAME and SITE_ID, and create site_widget

Dropdown widgets accept key-value pairs for the "options" field. This is desireable here because the SITE_ID can be set to the key, and subsequently utilized in queries when a user selects a site. The code below converts queried site data into name, value pairs.

```python
site_df.set_index('SITE_ID',inplace=True)
site_df.sort_values(by='SITE_NAME',inplace=True)
site_options = [('Select a site', -1)]
for key, value in site_df['SITE_NAME'].to_dict().items():
    site_options.append((value, key))
site_widget = widgets.Dropdown(options=site_options, description='Site')
```

### Create empty test_widget. This widget will get populated when a site is selected

```python
test_options = [('Select a test', -1)]
test_widget = widgets.Dropdown(options=test_options, description='Test', disabled=True)
widget_box= widgets.VBox([site_widget, test_widget])
display(widget_box)
```

### Create plot objects and initialize empty plots

```python
plot_widget = widgets.Output()
with plot_widget:
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(6,4), sharey='row')
    line1, = ax[0].plot([], [])
    ax[0].set_xlabel('Vs (m/s)')
    ax[0].set_ylabel('depth (m)')
    ax[0].grid(True)
    ax[0].invert_yaxis()
    line2, = ax[1].plot([], [])
    ax[1].set_xlabel('VP (m/s)')
    ax[1].grid(True)
    fig.tight_layout()
```

### Create empty metadata_widget. This widget will get populated when an invasive geophysical test is selected

```python
metadata_widget = widgets.HTML(value='')
```

### Define function for populating test_widget when a user selects a site from the site_widget dropdown

This code sets data for the plots to be empty, and sets the metadata widget to be empty as well. If the top-level field is selected (i.e., 'Select a Test'), then the test_widget is disabled.
If a site is selected, a SQL query is made on all of the invasive geophysical tests for that site, and the test dropdown is populated.

```python
def on_site_widget_change(change):
    ax[0].lines.clear()
    ax[1].lines.clear()
    metadata_widget.value=''
    if(change['new']==-1):
        test_widget.options = [('Select a test', -1)]
        test_widget.disabled = True
    else:
        test_options = [('Select a test', -1)]
        sql = 'SELECT DISTINCT TEST.TEST_ID, TEST.TEST_NAME FROM TEST '
        sql += 'INNER JOIN GINV ON TEST.TEST_ID = GINV.TEST_ID WHERE TEST.SITE_ID = ' + str(change['new'])
        test_df = ngl.read_sql(sql)
        test_df.set_index('TEST_ID',inplace=True)
        test_df.sort_values(by='TEST_NAME',inplace=True)
        for key, value in test_df['TEST_NAME'].to_dict().items():
            test_options.append((value, key))
        test_widget.options = test_options
        test_widget.disabled = False
    return
```

### Define function for querying geophysical data and metadata when a user selects an invasive geophysical test

```python
def on_test_widget_change(change):
    ax[0].lines.clear()
    ax[1].lines.clear()
    metadata_widget.value=''
    if(change['new']!=-1):
        sql = 'SELECT GIND.GIND_DPTH, GIND.GIND_VS, GIND.GIND_VP FROM GIND '
        sql += 'INNER JOIN GINV ON GIND.GINV_ID = GINV.GINV_ID WHERE GINV.TEST_ID = ' + str(change['new'])
        gind_df = ngl.read_sql(sql)
        line1, = ax[0].plot(gind_df['GIND_VS'].values, gind_df['GIND_DPTH'].values)
        line2, = ax[1].plot(gind_df['GIND_VP'].values, gind_df['GIND_DPTH'].values)
        for a in ax:
            a.relim()
            a.autoscale_view(True)
        fig.canvas.draw()
        sql = 'SELECT GINV.GINV_TYPE, GINV.GINV_CONF, GINV.GINV_CREW, GINV.GINV_STAR, GINV.GINV_ENDD'
        sql += ' FROM GINV WHERE GINV.TEST_ID = ' + str(change['new'])
        ginv_df = pd.read_sql_query(sql,cnx)
        metadata = "<strong>Invasive Geophysical Test Metadata</strong><br>"
        metadata += "Type = " + str(ginv_df ['GINV_TYPE'].values[0]) + '<br>'
        metadata += "Configuration = " + str(ginv_df ['GINV_CONF'].values[0]) + '<br>'
        metadata += "Crew = " + str(ginv_df ['GINV_CREW'].values[0]) + '<br>'
        metadata += "Start Date = " + str(ginv_df ['GINV_STAR'].values[0]) + '<br>'
        metadata += "End Date = " + str(ginv_df ['GINV_ENDD'].values[0]) + '<br>'
        metadata_widget.value = metadata
    else:
        ax[0].lines.clear()
        ax[1].lines.clear()
        metadata_widget.value=''
    return
```

### Use the ipywidgets 'observe' command to link widgets to appropriate functions on change
```python
site_widget.observe(on_site_widget_change, names='value')
test_widget.observe(on_test_widget_change, names='value')
display(plot_widget)
display(metadata_widget)
```

### Code

This section describes the [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.designsafe-ci.org/user/name/notebooks/CommunityData/NGL/DesignSafe_Webinar_Oct2021.ipynb) available via DesignSafe. The code is broken into chunks with explanations of each section of code.


#### Import ngl_db package
1) import the ngl_db package and other required packages

```python
try:
    %matplotlib widget
except:
    try:
        %matplotlib notebook
    except:
        print("Falling back to '%matplotlib inline'")
        
import ipywidgets as widgets
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import designsafe_db.ngl_db as ngl
import pandas as pd
```

#### Query SITE Table Using Pandas
An easy way to query the database is to use the Pandas read_sql command, which queries data and returns a Pandas dataframe.

1) import the Pandas package, 
2) create a string called sql that queries all information from the SITE table, and 
3) create a Pandas dataframe called df that contains the results of the query.


```python
sql = "SELECT * FROM SITE"
df = ngl.read_sql(sql)
df
```


#### Query all TESTs for a given SITE
This cell queries the TEST table looking for all TESTs with the same SITE_ID


```python
site_id = 159
sql = 'SELECT * FROM TEST where TEST.SITE_ID = "{}"'.format(site_id)
TESTdf = ngl.read_sql(sql)
TESTdf
```


#### Query CPT Metadata (SCPG) for a given TEST
This cell queries the SCPG table for a single CPT test


```python
test_id = TESTdf['TEST_ID'][1]
sql = 'SELECT * FROM SCPG where SCPG.TEST_ID = "{}"'.format(test_id)
SCPGdf = ngl.read_sql(sql)
SCPGdf
```


#### Plot CPT Data (SCPT) for a given TEST
This cell uses matplotlib to plot CPT data located in the SCPT table

```python
scpg_id = SCPGdf['SCPG_ID'][0]
sql = 'SELECT * FROM SCPT where SCPT.SCPG_ID = "{}"'.format(scpg_id)
SCPTdf = ngl.read_sql(sql)

#plot cone tip resistance, friction resistance, and pore pressures
fig,axs = plt.subplots(ncols=3, figsize=(7,6),sharey=True)
axs[0].invert_yaxis() #moves zero depth to the top of the plot
axs[0].plot(SCPTdf['SCPT_RES'],SCPTdf['SCPT_DPTH'])
axs[1].plot(SCPTdf['SCPT_FRES'],SCPTdf['SCPT_DPTH'])
axs[2].plot(SCPTdf['SCPT_PWP'],SCPTdf['SCPT_DPTH'])
axs[0].set_xlabel('Cone Tip Resistance (MPa)')
axs[1].set_xlabel('Sleeve Friction (MPa)')
axs[2].set_xlabel('Pore Pressure (MPa)')
axs[0].set_ylabel('Depth (m)')
for ax in axs:
    ax.grid(True, alpha=0.5)
plt.tight_layout()
```


#### Get WATR information for given TEST_ID
This cell extracts the depth to groundwater from the WATR table for the same TEST_ID specified earlier


```python
sql = 'SELECT * FROM WATR'
sql += ' Where WATR.TEST_ID = "{}"'.format(test_id)
waterdf = ngl.read_sql(sql)
z_gwt = waterdf['WATR_DPTH'].values[0]
waterdf
```


#### Put it all together!
This cell puts everything together in one cell, and adds horizontal lines representing the groundwater table to the plot.


```python
site_id = 159
sql = 'SELECT * FROM TEST where TEST.SITE_ID = "{}"'.format(site_id)
TESTdf = ngl.read_sql(sql)

#Get SCPG_ID for given TEST_ID
test_id = TESTdf['TEST_ID'][1]
sql = 'SELECT * FROM SCPG where SCPG.TEST_ID = "{}"'.format(test_id)
SCPGdf = ngl.read_sql(sql)

#get SCPT data for a given SCPG_ID, and load into Pandas dataframe
scpg_id = SCPGdf['SCPG_ID'][0]
sql = 'SELECT * FROM SCPT where SCPT.SCPG_ID = "{}"'.format(scpg_id)
SCPTdf = ngl.read_sql(sql)

#get WATR data for same TEST_ID
sql = 'SELECT * FROM WATR'
sql += ' Where WATR.TEST_ID = "{}"'.format(test_id)
waterdf = ngl.read_sql(sql)
z_gwt = waterdf['WATR_DPTH'].values[0]

#plot cone tip resistance, friction resistance, and pore pressures, with horizontal line for GWT
fig,axs = plt.subplots(ncols=3, figsize=(7,6),sharey=True)
axs[0].invert_yaxis() #moves zero depth to the top of the plot
axs[0].plot(SCPTdf['SCPT_RES'],SCPTdf['SCPT_DPTH'])
axs[1].plot(SCPTdf['SCPT_FRES'],SCPTdf['SCPT_DPTH'])
axs[2].plot(SCPTdf['SCPT_PWP'],SCPTdf['SCPT_DPTH'])
axs[0].set_xlabel('Cone Tip Resistance (MPa)')
axs[1].set_xlabel('Sleeve Friction (MPa)')
axs[2].set_xlabel('Pore Pressure (MPa)')
axs[0].set_ylabel('Depth (m)')
for ax in axs:
    ax.grid(alpha=0.5)
    ax.axhline(z_gwt,color='b')
plt.tight_layout()
```


#### Query all SITE and TEST fields that have both SCPG and WATR
If you want to find another SITE_ID/TEST_ID/SCPG_ID combination to try with this notebook, you can use a JOIN statement to combine the SITE, TEST, SCPG, and WATR tables to find tests where there is CPT information and groundwater table information


```python
sql = 'SELECT SITE.SITE_ID, SITE.SITE_NAME, TEST.TEST_ID, TEST.TEST_NAME, SCPG.SCPG_ID, WATR.WATR_ID '
sql += 'FROM SITE INNER JOIN TEST ON TEST.SITE_ID = SITE.SITE_ID '
sql += 'INNER JOIN SCPG ON SCPG.TEST_ID = TEST.TEST_ID '
sql += 'INNER JOIN WATR ON WATR.TEST_ID = TEST.TEST_ID'

test_metadata = ngl.read_sql(sql)
test_metadata
```
