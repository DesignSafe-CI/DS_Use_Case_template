# Use Case Products and Documentation

DesignSafe provides a wide variety of resources that allow researchers to effectively share, find, analyze, and publish data; perform numerical simulations and utilize high performance computing (HPC); and integrate diverse datasets.  

To help users fully embrace DesignSafe functionalities, we have developed a suite of Use Cases that demonstrate how DesignSafe is being used to advance natural hazards research.  Practical products, examples, and scripts developed as part of these Use Cases are documented in the sections below.  

* [**Site Response Analysis and Model Calibration**](arduino/usecase.md) (OpenSees, SimCenter quoFEM, Jupyter, HPC)
* [**Data Analysis using Next Generation Liquefaction (NGL) Database**](brandenberg/usecase.md) (NGL, Jupyter, SQL, Interactive Data Analytics)
* [**Large-Scale Ensemble Simulations of Storm Surge**](dawson/usecase.md)  (ADCIRC, pylauncher, Jupyter, HPC)
* [**Damage Tagging of Field Images**](haan/usecase.md) (Taggit, HazMapper)
